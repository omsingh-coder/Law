    <h1>M.C. Mehta v. Union of India (Oleum Gas Leak Case, 1987)</h1><h2>Background</h2>
<p>
  On 4 and 6 December 1985, oleum gas leaked from one of the units of Shriram Food and Fertilizer Industries in Delhi, leading to the death of an advocate and several injuries. This occurred shortly after the Bhopal Gas Tragedy and raised serious concerns about industrial safety and environmental protection in India.
</p>
<p>
  Renowned environmental lawyer <strong>M.C. Mehta</strong> filed a public interest litigation (PIL) under Article 32, seeking closure of the plant and enforcement of citizens’ right to a clean and safe environment under Article 21.
</p>

<h2>Key Legal Issues</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Is the Right to a healthy environment part of the Right to Life under Article 21?</li>
  <li>Can an enterprise engaged in hazardous industry be held absolutely liable for any damage?</li>
  <li>Should victims of industrial disasters be given speedy and adequate compensation?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Arguments</h2>
<p>
  <strong>Petitioner (M.C. Mehta):</strong> Argued that dangerous industrial operations pose a threat to the fundamental right to life, and corporations must be held liable for harm caused, irrespective of negligence.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Respondent (Shriram Industries):</strong> Contended that the leak was accidental, and the company followed necessary safety protocols. They argued against strict liability without proof of negligence.
</p>

<h2>Judgment</h2>
<p>
  The Supreme Court delivered a landmark judgment and established a new principle in Indian environmental jurisprudence:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Absolute Liability:</strong> The Court laid down that any enterprise engaged in hazardous or inherently dangerous activity is <strong>absolutely liable</strong> to compensate victims, <strong>regardless of fault or negligence</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Higher Standard:</strong> This is stricter than the rule of strict liability laid down in Rylands v. Fletcher, as no exceptions are allowed.</li>
  <li><strong>Article 21 Expanded:</strong> The Court ruled that the Right to Life includes the right to live in a healthy and pollution-free environment.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Significance</h2>
<p>
  - Established the doctrine of <strong>Absolute Liability</strong> in India.<br>
  - Recognized <strong>environmental protection as part of Fundamental Rights</strong>.<br>
  - Marked the beginning of proactive environmental jurisprudence through PILs.<br>
  - Encouraged tighter industrial regulation and corporate responsibility.
</p>

<h2>Subsequent Impact</h2>
<p>
  The judgment set the foundation for multiple environment-related orders in the future:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Closure of polluting industries near the Taj Mahal (Taj Trapezium case)</li>
  <li>Vehicle emission standards and introduction of CNG in Delhi</li>
  <li>Mandating Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Quote from the Judgment</h2>
<p><strong>"Enterprises which are engaged in hazardous activities owe an absolute and non-delegable duty to the community to ensure no harm results... They are absolutely liable to compensate for such harm."</strong></p>
