    <h1>Navtej Singh Johar v. Union of India (2018)</h1><h2>Background</h2>
<p>
  In 2018, the Supreme Court of India revisited the controversial Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, which criminalized "carnal intercourse against the order of nature," effectively banning homosexual acts between consenting adults. This case came after the 2013 judgment in <strong>Suresh Kumar Koushal v. Naz Foundation</strong> had re-criminalized homosexuality by overturning the progressive 2009 Delhi High Court verdict.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Navtej Singh Johar</strong>, a dancer and LGBTQ+ rights activist, along with other petitioners including artists and professionals, filed a petition under Article 32 of the Constitution seeking recognition of their fundamental rights and striking down Section 377.
</p>

<h2>Key Legal Issues</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Does Section 377 violate the fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 14, 15, 19, and 21?</li>
  <li>Can consensual sexual activity between adults be criminalized in a constitutional democracy?</li>
  <li>Does the Constitution protect individual dignity, identity, and autonomy regardless of sexual orientation?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Arguments</h2>
<p>
  <strong>Petitioners:</strong> Argued that Section 377 violated their right to life with dignity, privacy, equality, and freedom of expression. It perpetuated stigma, discrimination, and exclusion.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Respondents (Union of India):</strong> Left the matter to the Court’s wisdom but did not oppose the decriminalization of consensual private acts between adults.
</p>

<h2>Judgment</h2>
<p>
  On <strong>6 September 2018</strong>, a unanimous Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court struck down Section 377 to the extent that it criminalized consensual sexual conduct between adults. The Court held:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Violation of Article 14:</strong> Section 377 was arbitrary and unfair.</li>
  <li><strong>Violation of Article 15:</strong> Discrimination based on sexual orientation is not permissible.</li>
  <li><strong>Violation of Article 21:</strong> Right to life includes the right to dignity, autonomy, and privacy.</li>
  <li><strong>Violation of Article 19:</strong> Expression of sexual identity is a part of freedom of expression.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Significance</h2>
<p>
  - Landmark judgment affirming <strong>LGBTQ+ rights in India</strong>.<br>
  - Declared that sexual orientation is an inherent part of identity.<br>
  - Affirmed the values of <strong>equality, dignity, and individual liberty</strong>.<br>
  - Became a cornerstone for future LGBTQ+ inclusion policies.
</p>

<h2>Quote from the Judgment</h2>
<p><strong>"What is natural to one may not be natural to another. But the said naturalness should not be used to violate the dignity and identity of another."</strong></p>

<p><strong>"The Constitution is a living document and its interpretation must be dynamic."</strong></p>
