    <h1>Indra Sawhney v. Union of India (1992)</h1><h2>Background</h2>
<p>
  Also known as the <strong>Mandal Commission case</strong>, this landmark judgment addressed the issue of reservations in government jobs and education for Other Backward Classes (OBCs). The case arose after the implementation of recommendations made by the Mandal Commission, which proposed <strong>27% reservation for OBCs</strong> in public employment.
</p>
<p>
  Indra Sawhney, a journalist and public interest petitioner, challenged the validity of the Office Memorandum issued in 1990, which sought to implement these recommendations. The petition argued that it violated the principle of equality under Article 14 of the Constitution.
</p>

<h2>Key Issues</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Can the State provide reservations solely based on caste?</li>
  <li>Does reservation violate the Right to Equality under Article 14 and Article 16?</li>
  <li>Is there a maximum cap on the percentage of reservation?</li>
  <li>Can economic criteria be considered for backwardness?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Judgment</h2>
<p>
  A 9-judge Constitution Bench delivered the judgment. Key rulings:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>27% reservation for OBCs upheld</strong> as constitutionally valid under Article 16(4).</li>
  <li><strong>Reservation must not exceed 50%</strong> except in extraordinary situations.</li>
  <li><strong>Economic criteria cannot be the sole basis for reservation</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>"Creamy layer" of OBCs must be excluded</strong> from reservation benefits to ensure true backward class upliftment.</li>
  <li>Reservations in <strong>promotions were struck down</strong>, later re-introduced by the 77th Amendment.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Significance</h2>
<p>
  - One of the most impactful social justice judgments in India.<br>
  - Introduced the concept of the <strong>creamy layer exclusion</strong>.<br>
  - Balanced affirmative action with merit-based principles.<br>
  - Set the <strong>50% ceiling limit</strong> for reservations.
</p>

<h2>Impact</h2>
<p>
  - Led to implementation of OBC reservations across public employment and educational institutions.<br>
  - Basis for later debates on <strong>reservation for EWS</strong> and <strong>reservation in promotions</strong>.<br>
  - Provided a framework for assessing backwardness beyond just caste.
</p>

<h2>Quote from Judgment</h2>
<p><strong>"Reservation is not an end, it is a means; a means to secure social and educational justice as contemplated by Articles 15 and 16."</strong></p>
