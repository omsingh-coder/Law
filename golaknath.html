    <h1>Golak Nath v. State of Punjab (1967)</h1><h2>Background</h2>
<p>
  The Golak Nath family owned over 500 acres of farmland in Punjab. With the passing of land ceiling laws and the Constitution (First, Fourth and Seventeenth Amendments), their land was taken by the state. The family challenged the validity of these constitutional amendments, arguing that they violated their <strong>Fundamental Rights</strong> under <strong>Article 14, 19, and 31</strong>.
</p>

<h2>Key Issues</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Does Parliament have the power to amend Fundamental Rights?</li>
  <li>Can amendments made under Article 368 be considered as “law” under Article 13(2)?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Arguments</h2>
<p>
  <strong>Petitioner (Golak Nath family):</strong><br>
  Argued that constitutional amendments that abridge fundamental rights are void as per Article 13(2), which prohibits the State from making any law that takes away Fundamental Rights.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Respondent (State of Punjab):</strong><br>
  Claimed that constitutional amendments are not "law" under Article 13 and therefore cannot be challenged on this ground.
</p>

<h2>Judgment</h2>
<p>
  In a 6:5 majority, the Supreme Court held that:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Fundamental Rights are sacrosanct and beyond the reach of Parliament.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Article 368 does not give Parliament the power to amend Part III of the Constitution.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Constitutional amendments are "law" within the meaning of Article 13(2).</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2>Significance</h2>
<p>
  - Marked the first major check on Parliament’s power to amend the Constitution.<br>
  - Declared Fundamental Rights as immutable.<br>
  - Triggered political debate and later led to the 24th Amendment, which explicitly gave Parliament power to amend any part of the Constitution.
</p>

<h2>Impact</h2>
<p>
  Although overruled by the Kesavananda Bharati case in 1973, Golak Nath set the stage for constitutional interpretation and emphasized the importance of Fundamental Rights in Indian democracy. It started a new era of judicial activism and constitutional protection.
</p>

<p><strong>Quote from Judgment:</strong> “Fundamental Rights are given a transcendental position under our Constitution.”</p>
