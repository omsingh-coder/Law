  <h1>Important Concepts from Law of Torts</h1>  <div class="tort">
    <h2>1. What is a Tort?</h2>
    <p>A tort is a civil wrong, other than breach of contract, which causes harm or loss and gives rise to legal liability. The person who commits a tort is called a tortfeasor.</p>
  </div>  <div class="tort">
    <h2>2. Essentials of Tort</h2>
    <p>
      - A wrongful act or omission<br>
      - Legal damage to a person<br>
      - The wrongful act must be of such a nature that it gives rise to a legal remedy.
    </p>
  </div>  <div class="tort">
    <h2>3. Types of Torts</h2>
    <p>
      - Negligence<br>
      - Nuisance<br>
      - Trespass (to person or property)<br>
      - Defamation<br>
      - Strict Liability<br>
      - Absolute Liability
    </p>
  </div>  <div class="tort">
    <h2>4. Negligence</h2>
    <p>Negligence means failure to take proper care which a reasonable person would take. To prove negligence, three things are needed: duty of care, breach of that duty, and resulting damage.</p>
  </div>  <div class="tort">
    <h2>5. Nuisance</h2>
    <p>Nuisance is an act which unlawfully interferes with a person's use or enjoyment of land. It may be public or private nuisance.</p>
  </div>  <div class="tort">

    <p>It means direct interference with the person or property of another without lawful justification. It may be trespass to person (assault, battery, false imprisonment) or to property.</p>
