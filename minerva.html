    <h1>Minerva Mills v. Union of India (1980)</h1><h2>Background</h2>
<p>
  Minerva Mills Ltd. was a textile mill located in Karnataka. In 1970, it was taken over by the Central Government under the Industries (Development and Regulation) Act, 1951. The constitutionality of this action was challenged by the mill owners.
</p>
<p>
  Simultaneously, the 42nd Constitutional Amendment (passed during the Emergency) had made significant changes to Articles 31C and 368, placing <strong>Directive Principles of State Policy (Part IV)</strong> above Fundamental Rights and removing judicial review from constitutional amendments.
</p>

<h2>Key Issues</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Can Parliament amend the Constitution in a way that destroys the Basic Structure?</li>
  <li>Do Directive Principles override Fundamental Rights?</li>
  <li>Is judicial review an essential part of the Constitution?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Arguments</h2>
<p><strong>Petitioners:</strong> Argued that the changes made by the 42nd Amendment violated the Basic Structure by eliminating judicial review and downgrading Fundamental Rights.</p>
<p><strong>Government:</strong> Defended the Amendment as necessary for implementing socio-economic reforms through Directive Principles.</p>

<h2>Judgment</h2>
<p>
  The Supreme Court, in a 4:1 majority, struck down clauses of the 42nd Amendment as unconstitutional. Key rulings:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Judicial Review is part of the Basic Structure</strong> and cannot be removed.</li>
  <li><strong>Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles must exist in harmony.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Parliament's power to amend is limited and subject to Basic Structure Doctrine.</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2>Significance</h2>
<p>
  - Reaffirmed the supremacy of the Constitution over parliamentary power.<br>
  - Prevented excessive dominance of Directive Principles over Fundamental Rights.<br>
  - Strengthened checks and balances between different organs of the State.
</p>

<h2>Impact</h2>
<p>
  Minerva Mills case fortified the Basic Structure Doctrine laid down in Kesavananda Bharati. It ensured that Parliament cannot dilute fundamental values like liberty, equality, and judicial independence under the guise of social reform.
</p>

<p><strong>Quote from Judgment:</strong> “The harmony and balance between Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles is an essential feature of the Constitution.”</p>
