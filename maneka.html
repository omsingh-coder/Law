    <h1>Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India (1978)</h1><h2>Background</h2>
<p>
  In 1977, <strong>Maneka Gandhi</strong>, a journalist and daughter-in-law of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, was issued a passport under the Passport Act, 1967. Within a week, she received a notice from the Regional Passport Office asking her to surrender the passport. No reason was cited except that it was in the "public interest".
</p>
<p>
  When Maneka Gandhi requested the reason for the withdrawal, the authorities refused to disclose it. She filed a writ petition under Article 32 of the Constitution directly in the Supreme Court, alleging that the government’s order violated her <strong>Fundamental Rights</strong>, particularly under <strong>Article 14, 19(1)(a), 19(1)(g), and Article 21</strong>.
</p>

<h2>Key Issues</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Does the "right to travel abroad" fall within the scope of Article 21?</li>
  <li>Can personal liberty be curtailed by a procedure that is arbitrary or unjust?</li>
  <li>Does Article 21 include the requirement of a fair and reasonable procedure?</li>
  <li>Should Articles 14, 19, and 21 be read together or separately?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Arguments</h2>
<p>
  <strong>Petitioner (Maneka Gandhi):</strong><br>
  The restriction was arbitrary and denied without affording her an opportunity of being heard. It violated the principles of natural justice and procedural fairness.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Respondent (Union of India):</strong><br>
  Claimed that the government had powers under the Passport Act to impound a passport in public interest and was not obligated to disclose reasons in every case.
</p>

<h2>Judgment</h2>
<p>
  The seven-judge constitutional bench delivered a unanimous verdict in favor of <strong>Maneka Gandhi</strong>. The Court held that:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Right to travel abroad is part of personal liberty under Article 21.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Any law affecting personal liberty must pass the test of reasonableness and must not be arbitrary.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>"Procedure established by law" under Article 21 must be just, fair, and reasonable—not fanciful, oppressive, or arbitrary.</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2>Golden Triangle Doctrine</h2>
<p>
  The Court observed that <strong>Articles 14, 19, and 21 are interlinked</strong> and cannot be treated as watertight compartments. Any law interfering with life and liberty must also be tested against equality under Article 14 and freedom under Article 19.
</p>

<h2>Highlights of the Case</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Overruled the narrow interpretation of Article 21 given in <em>A.K. Gopalan v. State of Madras</em> (1950).</li>
  <li>Expanded the scope of Article 21 to include dignity, privacy, right to shelter, and education.</li>
  <li>Emphasized the importance of procedural fairness and natural justice.</li>
  <li>Established that fundamental rights must be interpreted liberally.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Impact</h2>
<p>
  This case transformed the interpretation of Article 21 and opened the door to a broader reading of fundamental rights. It became the basis for future judgments on the right to privacy, right to shelter, and right to live with dignity.
</p>
<p>
  The doctrine that emerged from this case laid the foundation for a progressive, rights-based jurisprudence in India.
</p>

<p><strong>Quote from Judgment:</strong> "No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to a procedure established by law – which must be fair, just and reasonable, not arbitrary or oppressive."
