    <h1>Mohd. Ahmed Khan v. Shah Bano Begum (1985)</h1><h2>Background</h2>
<p>
  Shah Bano, a 62-year-old Muslim woman and mother of five, was divorced by her husband, Mohd. Ahmed Khan, in 1978. After the divorce, she filed a petition under Section 125 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC), seeking maintenance.
</p>
<p>
  Her husband argued that under Muslim Personal Law, he was only required to provide maintenance during the iddat period (roughly 3 months after divorce) and was not liable thereafter. This case eventually reached the Supreme Court.
</p>

<h2>Legal Issues</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Can a divorced Muslim woman claim maintenance under Section 125 of CrPC?</li>
  <li>Does personal law override the general law applicable to all citizens?</li>
  <li>Is the husband liable to maintain his wife beyond the iddat period?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Arguments</h2>
<p>
  <strong>Shah Bano's Counsel:</strong> Argued that Section 125 of CrPC applies to all citizens irrespective of religion, and the husband's duty to maintain his divorced wife exists if she cannot maintain herself.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Husband’s Counsel:</strong> Argued that under Muslim law, liability ends after iddat. Thus, general law (CrPC) shouldn’t apply to Muslims in personal matters.
</p>

<h2>Judgment</h2>
<p>
  The Supreme Court, in a landmark decision, ruled in favor of Shah Bano:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Section 125 of CrPC applies to all citizens regardless of religion.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>The husband is liable to provide maintenance even after the iddat period if the wife is unable to maintain herself.</strong></li>
  <li>The Court observed that personal laws cannot override constitutional rights and obligations under general law.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Significance</h2>
<p>
  - Strong affirmation of gender justice and secular legal principles.<br>
  - Sparked a national debate on the Uniform Civil Code (Article 44 of the Constitution).<br>
  - Became a flashpoint in Hindu-Muslim personal law discussions.
</p>

<h2>Aftermath</h2>
<p>
  Facing political pressure from orthodox sections, the then government passed the <strong>Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986</strong> which diluted the effect of the Shah Bano judgment by limiting maintenance rights under Muslim personal law.
</p>
<p>
  However, subsequent judgments and amendments clarified that Muslim women can still claim maintenance under CrPC if needed.
</p>

<h2>Quote from the Judgment</h2>
<p><strong>"There is no conflict between Section 125 and Muslim Personal Law. Section 125 is a secular provision applicable to all."</strong></p>
