    <h1>Naz Foundation v. Government of NCT of Delhi (2009)</h1><h2>Background</h2>
<p>
  The Naz Foundation, an NGO working on HIV/AIDS and sexual health, filed a Public Interest Litigation in the Delhi High Court in 2001 challenging the constitutional validity of <strong>Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC)</strong>, which criminalized "carnal intercourse against the order of nature," effectively criminalizing homosexual acts even between consenting adults.
</p>
<p>
  The petitioner argued that Section 377 violated fundamental rights guaranteed under the Indian Constitution, especially those related to dignity, privacy, and non-discrimination.
</p>

<h2>Key Legal Issues</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Does Section 377 violate the right to equality (Article 14)?</li>
  <li>Does it infringe upon the right to freedom (Article 19)?</li>
  <li>Does it violate the right to life and personal liberty (Article 21)?</li>
  <li>Is criminalization of consensual homosexual acts a breach of human dignity and privacy?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Arguments</h2>
<p>
  <strong>Naz Foundation:</strong> Argued that Section 377 marginalized the LGBTQ+ community, violated their right to privacy and dignity, and hindered HIV/AIDS prevention efforts.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Government (initially):</strong> Opposed the petition but later the Union Government left it to the wisdom of the court.
</p>

<h2>Judgment</h2>
<p>
  In a historic judgment delivered on <strong>2nd July 2009</strong>, the Delhi High Court read down Section 377 and held:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Section 377 is unconstitutional</strong> insofar as it criminalizes consensual sexual acts between adults in private.</li>
  <li><strong>Violation of Article 21:</strong> It infringes the right to dignity, privacy, and health.</li>
  <li><strong>Violation of Article 14:</strong> The provision is arbitrary and unfair toward a specific class of people.</li>
  <li><strong>Violation of Article 15:</strong> Discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is not permitted.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Significance</h2>
<p>
  - First Indian judgment to decriminalize homosexuality.<br>
  - Recognized <strong>sexual orientation as a ground of non-discrimination</strong>.<br>
  - Marked a shift in Indian jurisprudence toward inclusion and human rights.<br>
  - Strengthened the LGBTQ+ movement and public awareness.
</p>

<h2>Aftermath</h2>
<p>
  - The judgment was overturned by the Supreme Court in <strong>Suresh Kumar Koushal v. Naz Foundation (2013)</strong>.<br>
  - However, it laid the foundation for the final decriminalization in <strong>Navtej Singh Johar v. Union of India (2018)</strong>, where the Supreme Court unanimously struck down Section 377.
</p>

<h2>Quote from the Judgment</h2>
<p><strong>"If there is one constitutional tenet that can be said to be underlying the Constitution, it is that of inclusiveness... Indian Constitution reflects this value deeply ingrained in Indian society."</strong></p>
