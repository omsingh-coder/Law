    <h1>Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala (1973)</h1><h2>Background</h2>
<p>
  Swami Kesavananda Bharati, head of the Edneer Mutt in Kerala, filed a petition under Article 26 (freedom to manage religious affairs) challenging the Kerala Land Reforms Act, 1963. The Act aimed to impose restrictions on the management of religious property. The case soon turned into a constitutional debate on the power of Parliament to amend the Constitution.
</p>

<p>
  Om challenge came in the context of earlier amendments like the 24th, 25th, and 29th Amendments to the Constitution, which sought to limit the judiciary’s power to review constitutional amendments and expanded Parliament’s amending power.
</p>

<h2>Issues Raised</h2>
<p>
  - Can Parliament amend any part of the Constitution, including Part III which contains Fundamental Rights?<br>
  - Are the 24th, 25th, and 29th Constitutional Amendments valid?<br>
  - Is there any limitation to the amending power of Parliament under Article 368?
</p>

<h2>Arguments</h2>
<p>
  <strong>Petitioner:</strong> Argued that Fundamental Rights form the core of the Constitution and should not be amendable.<br>
  <strong>Government:</strong> Argued that Parliament has unlimited power to amend the Constitution under Article 368.
</p>

<h2>Judgment</h2>
<p>
  Delivered by a 13-judge constitutional bench — the largest in Indian history — the court gave a split decision (7:6). The majority held that **Parliament can amend any provision of the Constitution including Fundamental Rights**, but **cannot destroy or alter the basic structure** or essential features of the Constitution.
</p>

<h2>Doctrine of Basic Structure</h2>
<p>
  The judgment gave birth to the landmark <strong>Basic Structure Doctrine</strong>, stating that while Parliament can amend the Constitution, it cannot destroy or damage its fundamental identity. Basic structure includes:
  <ul>
    <li>Supremacy of the Constitution</li>
    <li>Republican and democratic form of government</li>
    <li>Secular character of the Constitution</li>
    <li>Separation of powers</li>
    <li>Federalism</li>
    <li>Judicial Review</li>
    <li>Rule of Law</li>
    <li>Free and fair elections</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h2>Significance</h2>
<p>
  - Defined limits to Parliament’s amending powers.<br>
  - Reaffirmed judicial review and the role of the judiciary in protecting constitutional values.<br>
  - Ensured that fundamental rights and democratic values remain protected.<br>
  - Forms the backbone of modern constitutional interpretation in India.
</p>

<h2>Impact</h2>
<p>
  The doctrine has been repeatedly upheld in later cases such as Indira Nehru Gandhi v. Raj Narain and Minerva Mills v. Union of India. It continues to guide constitutional amendments and judicial decisions, protecting India's democratic framework.
