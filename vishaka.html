    <h1>ADM Jabalpur v. Shivkant Shukla (1976)</h1><h2>Background</h2>
<p>
  This case is famously known as the <strong>Habeas Corpus case</strong>. It arose during the Emergency period (1975–1977) declared by the Indira Gandhi government under Article 352 of the Constitution. Fundamental Rights under Article 14, 21, and 22 were suspended. Thousands of people, including political opponents, journalists, and activists, were detained without trial.
</p>
<p>
  Many detainees filed habeas corpus petitions (demanding release), but the government rejected them. One such case was brought by <strong>Shivkant Shukla</strong> against the ADM of Jabalpur, which eventually reached the Supreme Court.
</p>

<h2>Key Issues</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Can a person approach the court for enforcement of Fundamental Rights during Emergency?</li>
  <li>Is the right to life and liberty under Article 21 suspended during Emergency?</li>
  <li>Is judicial remedy completely barred?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Arguments</h2>
<p>
  <strong>Petitioner (Shivkant Shukla):</strong><br>
  Argued that the right to life and liberty is inalienable and even during Emergency, courts must protect individual rights against unlawful detention.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Respondent (Government of India):</strong><br>
  Claimed that under Article 359, once Emergency is declared, even the right to move court for Fundamental Rights is suspended. The detention orders were passed legally.
</p>

<h2>Judgment</h2>
<p>
  In a controversial 4:1 majority, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the government:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Citizens do not have the right to approach courts for Article 21 during Emergency.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Writ of habeas corpus cannot be issued during suspension of Fundamental Rights.</strong></li>
  <li>The only dissent came from <strong>Justice H.R. Khanna</strong>, who upheld the inviolability of life and liberty.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Justice H.R. Khanna's Famous Dissent</h2>
<p>
  Justice Khanna wrote that even in times of Emergency, life and liberty cannot be extinguished by executive action. His powerful line:
</p>
<p><strong>"Even when the Constitution is silent, life cannot be taken away without the authority of law."</strong></p>
<p>
  His dissent is celebrated as a symbol of judicial courage. He was superseded in seniority and denied the Chief Justice position, but his integrity is hailed in Indian legal history.
</p>

<h2>Significance</h2>
<p>
  - The case is seen as a <strong>dark chapter</strong> in Indian constitutional history.<br>
  - Exposed the vulnerabilities in judicial independence during authoritarian rule.<br>
  - Led to public outrage and stronger constitutional safeguards after the Emergency.
</p>

<h2>Impact</h2>
<p>
  After the Emergency, the 44th Constitutional Amendment was passed in 1978 which made it clear that Article 21 cannot be suspended even during an Emergency. ADM Jabalpur was effectively overruled by later decisions.
</p>

<h2>Legacy</h2>
<p>
  In 2017, during the Right to Privacy case (Justice K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India), the Supreme Court formally overruled ADM Jabalpur, calling it "seriously flawed" and a violation of constitutional principles.
</p>

<p><strong>Quote from Later Bench:</strong> “ADM Jabalpur is an aberration in constitutional jurisprudence.”</p>
